# Problem:
There is a need for a comprehensive healthcare recommendation system that seamlessly integrates symptom analysis, doctor recommendations, and medication suggestions to assist users in making informed decisions about their healthcare needs. To help people make well-informed decisions about their healthcare needs, a complete healthcare recommendation system that smoothly incorporates symptom analysis, doctor advice, and drug prescriptions is needed. Current systems tend to concentrate on recommending doctors or pharmaceuticals in isolation; there isn't a single system that takes care of both at the same time.
The project aims to develop a healthcare recommendation system that utilizes AI technology to analyze user symptoms, medical history, and other relevant factors to predict diseases, recommend appropriate medicines, and suggest specialist doctors. This system addresses the challenge of efficiently matching patients with suitable medical professionals and treatments, ultimately improving healthcare accessibility and patient outcomes. It caters to individuals seeking medical advice and assistance in making informed healthcare decisions.
