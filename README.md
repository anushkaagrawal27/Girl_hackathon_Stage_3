# Problem:
There is a need for a comprehensive healthcare recommendation system that seamlessly integrates symptom analysis, doctor recommendations, and medication suggestions to assist users in making informed decisions about their healthcare needs. To help people make well-informed decisions about their healthcare needs, a complete healthcare recommendation system that smoothly incorporates symptom analysis, doctor advice, and drug prescriptions is needed. Current systems tend to concentrate on recommending doctors or pharmaceuticals in isolation; there isn't a single system that takes care of both at the same time.
# Solution 

The Medical Assistant project aims to develop a healthcare recommendation system that assists users in finding appropriate doctors based on their symptoms, preferences, and schedules. Leveraging symptom data, healthcare provider databases, and user ratings, this system offers personalized recommendations tailored to individual needs.

# Features
Symptom Analysis: Users can input their symptoms, and the system will analyze them to generate relevant recommendations.

Doctor Recommendations: Recommends doctors with specialties that match the user's symptoms and preferences.

User Ratings: Incorporates user ratings to provide recommendations based on doctor reputation and patient satisfaction.

Scalability: Designed to be scalable for future integration with real-world healthcare databases.

Medication Recommendations: Recommends medications based on the user's symptoms and medical history.
